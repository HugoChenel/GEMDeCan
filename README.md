GEMDeCan: Gene Expression and Methylation based Deconvolution for Cancer

## Welcome to the GEMDeCan repository.  
You will find here two snakemake pipelines to process and perform deconvolution on gene expression and methylation data, in the respectively named folders.  
Each pipeline comes with a readme detailing its installation and usage.

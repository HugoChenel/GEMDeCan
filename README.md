GEMDeCan: Gene expression and metilation based deconvolution for Cancer

## Welcome to the GEMDeCan repository.  
You will find here two snakemake pipelines to perform deconvolution on gene expression and methylation data, in the respectively names folders.  
Each pipeline comes with a readme detailing its installation and usage.

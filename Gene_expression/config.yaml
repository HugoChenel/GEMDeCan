# If Do_rnaseq = “yes” and Convert_bcl2fastq = “no”, provide the path to the file listing your samples’ names.
# If Do_rnaseq = “yes” and Convert_bcl2fastq = “yes”, the pipeline will automatically create the file listing your samples’ names, based on the .csv Illumina samplesheet. This file will be created under the main directory.

# If Do_rnaseq = “yes”, this is a required parameter for the trimming process : Trimmomatic or Trimgalore

# If Compute_index = “yes” and Quantification_with = kallisto, please provide the path to the CDNA file. The generated index will be created under data/genome/kallisto_transcript.idx
# If Compute_index = “yes” and Quantification_with = salmon, please provide the path to the CDNA file. The generated index folder will be created at the location data/genome/salmon_index
